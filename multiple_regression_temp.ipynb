    "### Interpreting the Results of the Regression\n",

The 'coef' column contains the values of $\\beta_i$ for each rows' explanatory variable $x_i$ from our regression equation. Using this we can write out our regression equation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "sales = 2.9389 ~~+~~ 0.0458 \\times \\text{TV_budget} ~~+~~ 0.1185 \\times \\text{radio_budget} ~~+~~-0.0010 \\times \\text{newspaper_budget} ~~+~~ \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation tells us that for each additional \\\\$1000 spent on TV advertising, we expect on average, an increase in sales of 45 units, and for each additional \\\\$1000 spent on radio advertising, we expect on average, an increase in sales of 188 units. Since the p value for both of these variable is low (near zero in fact) we can assume that their effects on sales is significant to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further we can assume that newspaper spending is not significant in our model and thusly does not contribute to it. This is supported by the newspaper parameter's very high p value of 0.86. This means it is quite likely that any effect on sales from newspaper advertising is purely from random noise, which allows us to remove it from our model entirely."

Recall that in the simple linear regression, newspaper advertising was predicted to have an effect of 0.0547 with a p value of 0.001. To explain why in our multiple linear regression this effect droped to zero, we need to look at the correlation between the variables we used."

    "As we can see, the correlation between radio advertising and newspaper advertising is about 0.35. This positive correlation indicates that in some cases, spending on radio advertising is accompanied by spending on newspaper advertising. This leads to a series of events that explains newspaper's perceived significance in the simple linear regression.\n",

    "First, radio advertising increases leading to increased sales. Second, since radio advertising and newspaper advertising are correlated, newspaper advertising also increases. Then finally, since newspaper advertising and sales both increased, we observe that newspaper advertising increased sales despite the fact that radio advertising was the actual cause of the increase.\n",

    "Our simple linear regression model sees this chain of events and cannot pick out the contribution to sales by radio advertising from newspaper advertising by itself, so it reports a significant relationship between newspaper advertising and sales. Our multiple linear regression model is able to take radio advertising's effect on sales out of newspaper advertising's effect on sales revealing that newspaper ads do not have a significant effect on sales."

    "### Important Concepts to Explore\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is a powerful tool, but it is also accompanied by its share of weaknesses. Multiple linear regression can account for dozens or more predictors (explanatory variables). This means that we can create more robust models than a simple linear regression, however this also means that, as more variables are added to the model, the harder it will become to explain the model, and the harder it will become to account for the correlation between each individual predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, if we introduce explanatory variables to the model that do not actually have a significant effect on the response variable, either due to the nature of the variable or its correlation with another variable, we can essentially spend time learning \"the wrong thing\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these two concepts and their potential impacts on the model itself, determining the optimal group of explanatory variables is no simple task. There is no definitive right way to determine arguably the most important aspect of the model itself.\n",
