Since the p value for both of these variables is low (near zero in fact) we can assume that their effects on sales is significant to the model.\n",

Recall that in the simple linear regression, newspaper advertising was predicted to have an effect of 0.0547 with a p value of 0.001. To explain why in our multiple linear regression this effect dropped to zero, we need to look at the correlation between the variables we used."
